                        The United States Marine Corps (USMC) is a branch of the United States Armed Forces responsible for providing power 
                        projection from the sea, using the mobility of the U.S. Navy to deliver combined-arms task forces rapidly. 
                        The Marine Corps is one of the eight uniformed services of the United States and is a component of the Department 
                        of the Navy. The Marine Corps is known for its rigorous training and high standards, making it one of the most elite 
                        fighting forces in the world.

                        the Bahamas, and later participated in the Battles of Trenton and Princeton, demonstrating their amphibious and land combat 
                        capabilities during the American Revolutionary War.
